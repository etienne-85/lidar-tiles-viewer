# Developement process

Project is split in several development phases (stages).

## Development phase

Each development phase has incremental building plan containing several steps/tasks to be completed in order.

On each new development phase:
- In `build-log` dir, create and fill `stageX.md` file, inspired from provided `template.md` file.
- Once ready, start incremental building plan.

At the end of incremental building plan, test, list and address any remaining
- bugs, 
- regressions,
- performance issues
- things requiring improvement

Once done before moving to next stage, update project docs (architectural changes, status, screenshots)
